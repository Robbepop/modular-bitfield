- `no_std`: Supports embedded development without `std` library.
- This crate uses 100% safe Rust code.

## Description

Allows to have bitfield structs and enums as bitfield specifiers that work very similar to C and C++ bitfields.

## Advantages

- **Safety:** Macro embraced enums and structs are checked for valid structure during compilation time.
- **Speed:** Generated code is as fast as handwritten code. (See benchmarks below.)
- **Modularity:** Enums can be used modular within bitfield structs.

## Attribution

Implements the `#[bitfield]` macros introduced and specified in David Tolnay's [procedural macro workshop][procedural-macro-workshop].

Thanks go to David Tolnay for designing the specification for the macros implemented in this crate.

## Usage

Annotate a Rust struct with the `#[bitfield]` attribute in order to convert it into a bitfield.
The `B1`, `B2`, ... `B128` prelude types can be used as primitives to declare the number of bits per field.

```rust
#[bitfield]
pub struct PackedData {
    header: B4,
    body: B9,
    is_alive: B1,
    status: B2,
}
 ```

This produces a `new` constructor as well as a variety of getters and setters that
allows to interact with the bitfield in a safe fashion:

### Example: Constructors

```rust
let data = PackedData::new()
    .with_header(1)
    .with_body(2)
    .with_is_alive(0)
    .with_status(3);
assert_eq!(data.header(), 1);
assert_eq!(data.body(), 2);
assert_eq!(data.is_alive(), 0);
assert_eq!(data.status(), 3);
```

### Example: Primitive Types

Any type that implements the `Specifier` trait can be used as a bitfield field.
Besides the already mentioned `B1`, .. `B128` also the `bool`, `u8, `u16, `u32,
`u64` or `u128` primitive types can be used from prelude.

We can use this knowledge to encode our `is_alive` as `bool` type instead of `B1`:

```rust
#[bitfield]
pub struct PackedData {
    header: B4,
    body: B9,
    is_alive: bool,
    status: B2,
}

let mut data = PackedData::new()
    .with_is_alive(true);
assert!(data.is_alive());
data.set_is_alive(false);
assert!(!data.is_alive());
```

### Example: Enum Specifiers

It is possible to derive the `Specifier` trait for `enum` types very easily to make
them also usable as a field within a bitfield type:

```rust
#[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
pub enum Status {
    Red, Green, Yellow, None,
}

#[bitfield]
pub struct PackedData {
    header: B4,
    body: B9,
    is_alive: bool,
    status: Status,
}
```

### Example: Extra Safety Guard

In order to make sure that our `Status` enum still requires exatly 2 bit we can add
`#[bits = 2]` to its field:

```rust
#[bitfield]
pub struct PackedData {
    header: B4,
    body: B9,
    is_alive: bool,
    #[bits = 2]
    status: Status,
}
```

Setting and getting our new `status` field is naturally as follows:

```rust
let mut data = PackedData::new()
    .with_status(Status::Green);
assert_eq!(data.status(), Status::Green);
data.set_status(Status::Red);
assert_eq!(data.status(), Status::Red);
```

### Example: Recursive Bitfields

It is possible to use `#[bitfield]` structs as fields of `#[bitfield]` structs.
This is generally useful if there are some common fields for multiple bitfields
and is achieved by adding `specifier = true` to the parameters of the `#[bitfield]`
attribute:

```rust
#[bitfield(specifier = true)]
pub struct Header {
    is_compact: bool,
    is_secure: bool,
    pre_status: Status,
}

#[bitfield]
pub struct PackedData {
    header: Header,
    body: B9,
    is_alive: bool,
    status: Status,
}
```

### Example: Advanced Enum Specifiers

For our `Status` enum we actually just need 3 status variants: `Green`, `Yellow` and `Red`.
We introduced the `None` status variants because `Specifier` enums by default are required
to have a number of variants that is a power of two. We can ship around this by specifying
`#[bits = 2]` on the top and get rid of our placeholder `None` variant while maintaining
the invariant of it requiring 2 bits:

```rust
# use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;

#[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
#[bits = 2]
pub enum Status {
    Red, Green, Yellow,
}
```

However, having such enums now yields the possibility that a bitfield might contain invalid bit
patterns for such fields. We can safely access those fields with protected getters. For the sake
of demonstration we will use the generated `from_bytes` constructor with which we can easily
construct bitfields that may contain invalid bit patterns:

```rust
let mut data = PackedData::from_bytes([0b0000_0000, 0b1100_0000]);
//           The 2 status field bits are invalid -----^^
//           as Red = 0x00, Green = 0x01 and Yellow = 0x10
assert_eq!(data.status_or_err(), Err(InvalidBitPattern { invalid_bytes: 0b11 }));
data.set_status(Status::Green);
assert_eq!(data.status_or_err(), Ok(Status::Green));
```

## Benchmarks

Below are some benchmarks between the [hand-written code][benchmark-code] and the macro-generated code for some example getters and setters that cover a decent variety of use cases.

We can conclude that the macro-generated code is as fast as hand-written code would be. Please file a PR if you see a way to improve either side.

- `cargo bench` to run the benchmarks
- `cargo test --benches` to run the benchmark tests

### Summary

The `modular_bitfield` crate generates bitfields that are ...

- just as efficient as the handwritten alternatives.
- equally efficient or more efficient than the alternative [bitfield] crate.

### Showcase: Generated vs Handwritten

We tested the following `#[bitfield]` `struct`:

```rust
#[bitfield]
pub struct Generated {
    pub a: B9,  // Spans 2 bytes.
    pub b: B6,  // Within 2nd byte.
    pub c: B13, // Spans 3 bytes.
    pub d: B1,  // Within 4rd byte.
    pub e: B3,  // Within 4rd byte.
    pub f: B32, // Spans rest 4 bytes.
}
```

**Note:** All benchmarks timing results sum 10 runs each.
