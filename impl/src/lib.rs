/// Applicable to structs to turn their fields into compact bitfields.
///
/// # Generated API
///
/// By default this generates the following API:
///
/// - **Constructors:**
///
///     1. `new()`: Initializes all bits to 0 even if 0 bits may be invalid.
///        Note that invalid bit patterns are supported in that getters and setters will
///        be protecting accesses.
///
/// - **Getters:**
///
///     For every field `f` we generate the following getters:
///
///     1. `f()`: Returns the value of `f` and might panic
///        if the value contains an invalid bit pattern.
///     2. `f_or_err()`: Returns the value of `f` or an error
///        if the value contains an invalid bit pattern.
///
/// - **Setters:**
///
///     For every field `f` we generate the following setters:
///
///     1. `set_f(new_value)`: Sets the value of `f` to `new_value` and might panic
///        if `new_value` is out of bounds for the bit width of `f`.
///     2. `set_f_checked(new_value)`: Sets the value of `f` to `new` or returns an error
///        if `new_value` if out of bounds for the bit width of `f`.
///     3. `with_f(new_value)`: Similar to `set_f` but consumes and returns `Self`.
///        Primarily useful for method chaining.
///     4. `with_f_checked(new_value)`: Similar to `set_f_checked` but consumes and returns `Self`.
///        Primarily useful for method chaining.
///
/// - **Conversions:**
///
///     - `from_bytes(bytes)`: Allows to constructor the bitfield type from a fixed array of bytes.
///     - `into_bytes()`: Allows to convert the bitfield into its underlying byte representation.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// The following parameters for the `#[bitfield]` macro are supported:
///
/// ## Parameter: `bytes = N`
///
/// This ensures at compilation time that the resulting `#[bitfield]` struct consists of
/// exactly `N` bytes. Yield a compilation error if this does not hold true.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield(bytes = 2)]
/// pub struct SingedInt {
///     sign: bool, //  1 bit
///     value: B15, // 15 bits
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Parameter: `filled: bool`
///
/// If `filled` is `true` ensures that the `#[bitfield]` struct defines all bits and
/// therefore has a bitwidth that is divisible by 8. If `filled` is `false` ensures the
/// exact opposite.
///
/// The default value is: `true`
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield(filled = false)]
/// pub struct Package {
///     is_received: bool, // 1 bit
///     is_alive: bool,    // 1 bit
///     status: B2,        // 2 bits
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Parameter: `bits = N`
///
/// With the `bits: int` parameter it is possible to control the targeted bit width of
/// a `#[bitfield]` annoated struct. Using `bits = N` guarantees that the resulting bitfield
/// struct will have a bit width of exactly `N`.
///
/// ### Example 1
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield(bits = 16)]
/// pub struct Package {
///     is_received: bool, // 1 bit
///     is_alive: bool,    // 1 bit
///     status: B14,       // 14 bits
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Example 2
///
/// The `bits: int` parameter is especially useful when using this in conjunction with
/// `#[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)] and `filled = false` as shown in the below example.
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield(bits = 5)]
/// #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
/// pub struct Package {
///     is_received: bool, // 1 bit
///     is_alive: bool,    // 1 bit
///     status: B3,        // 3 bits
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Field Parameter: `#[bits = N]`
///
/// To ensure at compile time that a field of a `#[bitfield]` struct has a bit width of exactly
/// `N` a user may add `#[bits = N]` to the field in question.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// # #[bitfield(filled = false)]
/// # #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
/// # pub struct Header {
/// #     is_received: bool, // 1 bit
/// #     is_alive: bool,    // 1 bit
/// #     status: B2,        // 2 bits
/// # }
/// #[bitfield]
/// pub struct Base {
///     #[bits = 4]
///     header: Header, //  4 bits
///     content: B28,   // 28 bits
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Field Parameter: `#[skip(..)]`
///
/// It is possible to skip the entire code generation for getters or setters with the `#[skip]`
/// field attribute.
/// This is useful if a field just needs to be read or written exclusively. Skipping both
/// setters and getters is useful if you want to have undefined blocks within your bitfields.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield]
/// pub struct Sparse {
///     #[skip(getters)]
///     no_getters: B4,
///     #[skip(setters)]
///     no_setters: B4,
///     #[skip]
///     skipped_entirely: B4,
///     #[skip(getters, setters)]
///     skipped_entirely_2: B2,
///     #[skip(getters)] #[skip(setters)]
///     skipped_entirely_2: B2,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Trick: Wildcards
///
/// If you are completely uninterested in a field of a bitfield, for example when specifying
/// some undefined bits in your bitfield you can use double wildcards as their names:
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield]
/// pub struct Sparse {
///     #[skip] __: B10,
///     a: bool,
///     #[skip] __: B10,
///     b: bool,
///     #[skip] __: B10,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Features
///
/// ## Support: `#[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]`
///
/// If a `#[bitfield]` struct is annotated with a `#[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]` attribute
/// an implementation of the `Specifier` trait will be generated for it. This has the effect
/// that the bitfield struct itself can be used as the type of a field of another bitfield type.
///
/// This feature is limited to bitfield types that have a total bit width of 128 bit or fewer.
/// This restriction is ensured at compile time.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield(filled = false)]
/// #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
/// pub struct Header {
///     is_received: bool, // 1 bit
///     is_alive: bool,    // 1 bit
///     status: B2,        // 2 bits
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now the above `Header` bitfield type can be used in yet another `#[bitfield]` annotated type:
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// # #[bitfield(filled = false)]
/// # #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
/// # pub struct Header {
/// #     is_received: bool, // 1 bit
/// #     is_alive: bool,    // 1 bit
/// #     status: B2,        // 2 bits
/// # }
/// #[bitfield]
/// pub struct Base {
///     header: Header, //  4 bits
///     content: B28,   // 28 bits
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Support: `#[derive(Debug)]`
///
/// If a `#[derive(Debug)]` is found by the `#[bitfield]` a naturally formatting implementation
/// is going to be generated that clearly displays all the fields and their values as the user
/// would expect.
/// Also invalid bit patterns for fields are clearly displayed under this implementation.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield]
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct Package {
///     is_received: bool, // 1 bit
///     is_alive: bool,    // 1 bit
///     status: B6,        // 6 bits
/// }
///
/// let package = Package::new()
///     .with_is_received(false)
///     .with_is_alive(true)
///     .with_status(3);
/// println!("{:?}", package);
/// assert_eq!(
///     format!("{:?}", package),
///     "Package { is_received: false, is_alive: true, status: 3 }",
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ## Support: `#[repr(uN)]`
///
/// It is possible to additionally annotate a `#[bitfield]` annotated struct with `#[repr(uN)]`
/// where `uN` is one of `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64` or `u128` in order to make it conveniently
/// interchangeable with such an unsigned integer value.
///
/// As an effect to the user this implements `From` implementations between the chosen primitive
/// and the bitfield as well as ensuring at compile time that the bit width of the bitfield struct
/// matches the bit width of the primitive.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #[bitfield]
/// #[repr(u16)]
/// pub struct SignedU16 {
///     sign: bool,     //  1 bit
///     abs_value: B15, // 15 bits
/// }
///
/// let sint = SignedU16::from(0b0111_0001);
/// assert_eq!(sint.sign(), true);
/// assert_eq!(sint.abs_value(), 0b0011_1000);
/// assert_eq!(u16::from(sint), 0b0111_0001_u16);
/// ```

/// Derive macro for Rust `enums` to implement `Specifier` trait.
///
/// This allows such an enum to be used as a field of a `#[bitfield]` struct.
/// The annotated enum must not have any variants with associated data and
/// by default must have a number of variants that is equal to the power of 2.
///
/// If a user wants to circumvent the latter restriction they can add
/// `#[bits = N]` below the `#[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]` line in order to
/// signal to the code generation that the enum may have a relaxed number
/// of variants.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ## Example: Basic Usage
///
/// In the following we define a `MaybeWeekday` enum that lists all weekdays
/// as well as an invalid day so that we have a power-of-two number of variants.
///
/// ```
/// use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
/// pub enum Weekday {
///     Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, None
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Example: `#[bits = N]`
///
/// If we want to get rid of the `None` variant we need to add `#[bits = 3]`:
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #
/// #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
/// #[bits = 3]
/// pub enum Weekday {
///     Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Example: Discriminants
///
/// It is possible to explicitly assign discriminants to some of the days.
/// In our case this is useful since our week starts at sunday:
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #
/// #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
/// #[bits = 3]
/// pub enum Weekday {
///     Monday = 1,
///     Tuesday = 2,
///     Wednesday = 3,
///     Thursday = 4,
///     Friday = 5,
///     Saturday = 6,
///     Sunday = 0,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Example: Use in `#[bitfield]`
///
/// Given the above `Weekday` enum that starts at `Sunday` and uses 3 bits in total
/// we can now use it in a `#[bitfield]` annotated struct as follows:
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #
/// # #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier)]
/// # #[bits = 3]
/// # pub enum Weekday {
/// #     Monday = 1,
/// #     Tuesday = 2,
/// #     Wednesday = 3,
/// #     Thursday = 4,
/// #     Friday = 5,
/// #     Saturday = 6,
/// #     Sunday = 0,
/// # }
/// #[bitfield]
/// pub struct MeetingTimeSlot {
///     day: Weekday,
///     from: B6,
///     to: B6,
///     expired: bool,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The above `MeetingTimeSlot` uses exactly 16 bits and defines our `Weekday` enum as
/// compact `day` bitfield. The `from` and `to` require 6 bits each and finally the
/// `expired` flag requires a single bit.
///
/// ## Example: Interacting
///
/// A user can interact with the above `MeetingTimeSlot` and `Weekday` definitions in
/// the following ways:
///
/// ```
/// # use modular_bitfield::prelude::*;
/// #
/// # #[derive(BitfieldSpecifier, Debug, PartialEq)]
/// # #[bits = 3]
/// # pub enum Weekday {
/// #     Monday = 1,
/// #     Tuesday = 2,
/// #     Wednesday = 3,
/// #     Thursday = 4,
/// #     Friday = 5,
/// #     Saturday = 6,
/// #     Sunday = 0,
/// # }
/// # #[bitfield]
/// # pub struct MeetingTimeSlot {
/// #     day: Weekday,
/// #     from: B6,
/// #     to: B6,
/// #     expired: bool,
/// # }
/// #
/// let mut slot = MeetingTimeSlot::new()
///     .with_day(Weekday::Friday)
///     .with_from(14) // 14:00 CEST
///     .with_to(15); // 15:00 CEST
/// assert_eq!(slot.day(), Weekday::Friday);
/// assert_eq!(slot.from(), 14);
/// assert_eq!(slot.to(), 15);
/// assert!(!slot.expired());
/// ```
